Svelte version of Rakun AI

This amazing AI project as we won1st place at the NASA SpaceApps hackathon in Ontario with it this October (didn’t make the global top 10 because it took another 2 months to actually get it to work). 
It’s a natural language speech-enabled document finding bot that’s designed to work offline, on any web-browser*, on any device*, on any planet. You jsut drop your docs in and talk to it. 
Excited to explore the solutions this opensource raccoon will now provide for mere humans as it’s already being adopted in manufacturing and medicine.

To install 

yarn install && yarn upgrade && yarn build && yarn start

Works for equivalent commands for npm or pnpm instead of yarn.
Built on latest Node 18 Long-Term_Support version, Node v16.16.0 (LTS) is cool too. Untested on anything older.
